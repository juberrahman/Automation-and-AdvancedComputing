Problem: Quick disaster response
When a disaster strikes, the World Food Programme (WFP), as well as the other humanitarian actors, need to design comprehensive emergency operations. They need to know what to bring and in which quantity. How many shelters? How many tons of food? These needs assessments are conducted by humanitarian experts, based on the first information collected, their knowledge and their experience.

What if we could use past disaster data to help them know what is needed?

No. of actual Predictors: 45
Target: Number of people affected
Validation scheme: 5-fold cross-validation, Test set performance, Unit test performance
Train set (80%), Test set (20%)
Models:

Random Forest (RF)
Gradient Boosting Method (GBM)
Support Vector Regression

Findings and Discussions:
Best performing model: Stack of Ensembles
Performance: RMSLE=2.41 , R-squared value=0.37
The model is good in predicting the mid-impact cyclones
For low impact cyclones predictions are over-estimated
Overall trend shows a weak but expected trend
